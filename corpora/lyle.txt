Hey. I heard you were makin' baseball cards for us. I want one.
Hey Ray! I need a hundred bucks. Can't say why.
Hey guys, I'm tryin' to sleep in here.
Not much. Nice work on the dog, Ray.
We still on for drinkin' tonight?
I'm a human! I invented a voice mail system where "7" means "delete"!
You guys want to come see my band's first gig?
Aw, c'mon! Lay off!
What's it matter? I got it, I have it! I can have anything.
It's neat! You never really see one 'a these. Just tryin' to keep my mind alive, you know?
I could hold it against a cappuccino! It might vibrate the cream decoration into a shape people like! You know how some guys can draw a leaf with a toothpick?
Maybe I'll open a coffee shop for perverts! It takes all kinds, pal!
Hey! Don't you knock?
Hold on -- you have a blog?
Why in the hell would anyone want to read your stupid opinions?
And how many morons read your site every day? Six?... /seven?/
Do your server logs tell you if they're wearing clear plastic diapers and pink pylons on their heads?
Sigh
What'n hell are you talkin' about, Darlene?
They call cause I never remember to pay the damn bill! You don't get mad when the guy from the phone company calls!
I think I gotta go take care 'a this, Wolcott.
What's that?
Yeah, I did. I was lazy.
I saw her two more times after that.
I saw Wolcott one more time.
I'm gettin' up there in years
It's your lucky day, T!
Wow, hat trick! And it ain't even noon!
Hold on - I thought her birthday was like in the spring?
Lord, what else've you promised that woman?
Except there's no cup to hit it into.
Oh man. Seven A.M. and sober as a Turk.
Ugh. Too early. Too early.
Why can't I wake up with the gin already in me?
No they didn't. That's the new bidet.
It shoots water up your butt.
A bidet's only as mean as the guy usin' it.
Welcome home, fellas. What'll it be?
Bah! Those crooks!
Did you guys know that the real Jared died at a Subway in 1998?
The franchise owner stole his pants and hired an actor named Dennis J. Carmichael to assume the identity of his "diet miracle boy." I don't need to tell you how he disposed of the body.
Welcome to Reality! Welcome to the Hard Life! Welcome to the Blues!
Welcome to... SEX FUNERAL!
But you didn't come here just because you wanted to play the Blues, did you?
You came here to write the next chapter in Blues history! The... illegal chapter!
Are you ready to break the rules? Are you ready to play the Blues that the government doesn't want heard?
Wish he'd let me play more than one note... frickin' control freak.
God, what a stupid lyric... And why's everybody always "springing" everywhere? Does he think that's the scariest way of getting around?
Oh no. A boiled lord's eyes were stolen. Is that really the scariest thing that can happen to some boiled eyes? Vision from beyond the grave, anyone? You hack.
Ha! Ha!
Guess who just got a bootleg of the Paul Prudhomme sex tape! Hint: Me. It was me. Living room, now.
Wait. If he was illiterate, how'd he read Bird's lyric sheet?
Pretty much, except for frickin' Pat's.
The guy plays all the angles! I started servin' booze to try and drum up business--
--and he had his friend on the city council shut me down for not havin' a liquor license!
And get a load of this flyer!
Heh!
It's actually called a Red Box.
Oldest trick in the book!
Ich habe keine Idee.
I'm lickin' this bra! Found it at the police station!
It's been on TITS, man! That's pretty much the only place one 'a these goes!
Male or Female?
They'll do anything for ten bucks. You want a go? Left cup's all yours.
Your loss, hombre. Have fun watchin' TV.
WHY FIND OUT
Eh, no problem. Good to be wrenchin' again.
Try it!
She made me feel amazing. I started sayin' stuff so good I didn't even know I could say it. It was like a goddamn genius was drivin' me with a joystick.
Hey there, britches. Priest's playin' at the Sherwin-Williams expo tonight--you'd look awful good at that concert with me.
Hell yes, babe. You ride with me, and I'll get you fucked UP first.
Oh, I'm gonna feed you, baby. Name's Lyle.
I don't eat where I shit, underpants. How's about a Chili Foot-long at Jumbo Hole and some SoCo in a hobo bag?
Yeah, give us a Chili Foot-long, a Blister Dog with shake and mustard, a Cabin Melt Plus, and two sides of beef'n'onion chop with extra Saltines.
Hard to say. I kicked a dude's ass, a different dude kicked my ass, she clawed at some bitch, and I think we either puked or fucked behind the beer tent.
Hey--you go see Priest in Florida, you're lucky if you don't wake up next to some guy named Death Steve who's eatin' a head like it was an apple.
I call any bottle that has a handle. You think I'm joking? I'm not! I want a huge amount to drink.
Téodor! Open up! I can't feel my sack!
Quiet! Law and Order's starting.
They always find a dead person. Be quiet.
Hush!
Well maybe they should!
OASIS!
Yeah, it's Friday afternoon. You guys beat it.
Hmm...only if you sower together. I need some photos to sell on the internet.
I don;t want 'em, no, but someone will. I'll gove you five bucks if you kiss.
How come only one of you is circumcised? Aren't you brothers?
What's that? Some piece of baloney from Sears?
Well you shouldn't 'a left it in the hallway!
Aw...alright. Sorry, Philippe. Want me to write you a new one?
Remember to put a dollar under the little tab every time you see Cunty! He needs that money to help him decide to win!
The only thing that's gonna destroy us is if we don't start sellin' things to all those dudes out there!
I'M Lyle! Come see the counter where it all happened, five bucks! Shake my hand for ten! Buy my hair!
The guy with the gold jewelry says he'd like to use the cart in his next gonzo shoot.
My uncle died, I inherited it. You want a sandwich or what?
Bah! Not hardly!
They're openin' up three more franchises on this same street!
Huh? Oh, hey Cropes. Yeah, I got an old Rick. What's up?
I'm cussing?
Whatever.
Holy christ! Your grandpa was Rustmouth?
Shove it, Philpipe!
Shaddup, you!
The cholo cooks at my new busin' gig load me down with tons of leftovers every night...
You wanna get in on the ground floor, here?
Oh HELL yes!
See that? Went about three fuckin' feet!
Three goddamned feet! You try that with one 'a your little Saturday morning bad boys! You'd be lucky just to raise the thing's temperature!
I spiraled it, by the way. That doesn't just happen by not caring.
Oooh! Look at the big woman with his little fan! Are you sitting on a doily, Mr. Lady-Lady?
Better not get that too close to your uterus! It might freeze your dainty little ovaries!
Maybe it's menopause! you ever hear of that, you dumb old broad? Ha ha ha!
Hey T! You play bass? I need someone to stand in for me.
Careful, shithead. I play the bass.
I... uh... I gotta go meet the children of Senator Dell Graham.
Oh, he's an old friend of my dad's. Kind of a pain, what can you do. Total formality.
We practice in Ray's spare room. Five o'clock.
Here's your taco. The doctors did everything they could. I'm.. I'm sorry.
Alright, it's real nice of you to use the Anarchist's Cookbook to get presents for your mom,
...but now let's use it to play pranks on people!
Yeah, like throwing a homemade smoke bomb through Pat's window!
Double-prank!
Remember that time he had the police shut down your lemonade stand because you didn't have a business license?
Alright, you go in there and spill a bunch of water on the floor in front of his toilet.
Good. Later, when he goes to take a leak, I'll flip the switch that connects the car battery to his toilet bowl.
It will electrocute his dick.
Very funny, Ray. What's goin' on.
Huh? I guess you could just write to her through the website...
GAH! If those clowns win the election I'm movin' to Canada!
Well, for starters, there's no water between here and Canada, unless you count the water you're gonna break when you're givin' birth to my pain-child!
Fine, then! I'll secede and have my own damn nation right here in the damn backyard!
I ain't gonna need any of that stuff! Energy's free, if you know how to harness it!
OK, Philippe. As soon as the chamber pot weighs more than you, this pulley system lifts you back up into headquarters, and you get a sword.
I wish someone would run over a turtle with a car! Today SUCKS!
Seriously? You're into this? I know a guy, we can make it happen.
Aw, nuts!
Yeah, I did! And I LIKED it!
I'll kick anything I want!
Of COURSE!
Where in the Bible does it say you can't kick Jesus?
Well, I could try!
Come back here! You haven't heard my ideas!
Who wants a smoke?
And who would prefer to spend five minutes alone in the bathroom with the new FAO Shwarz catalog?
I'm gettin' too old to play this game, man.
Back hurts every night, feet swell up so bad it stings to peel my socks off...
... I fell down carryin' one 'a those rubber floor mats tonight and couldn't get up for almost a minute.
Huh! You know I been makin' my bones in dumps and dives longer'n those pimply goons been alive... you might have something there!
Shit! Me, a fuckin' teacher! ACE OF GRADES!
No! How?
Heh! What's your porno name, Beef?
No way!
Eh, feckin' Playboy! I dunno why Téodor subscribes to this rag, it's just the same rouged plastic asshole month after month. Feh!
Feh!
Hey! Get lost! Go to hell!
Really?
Aw, I'm just pretendin' to have my own brand of whiskey...you know?
HOW MANY TIMES IN A ROW ARE YOU GOING TO LISTEN TO TOUCH OF GREY, YOU SON OF A BITCH?!
Like hell you are. Have you heard any of their other tracks?
Here, lemme pull up some of their stuff on YouTube.
Did you know that these dudes were so stoned, they had two drummers at the same time and didn't even notice?
What do you think this is, Todd? The Pet Shop Boys? Put some spine into it!
I've heard better music blown through panty hose! NEXT!
Hey! Where's the cabbage I farted by the J-Lo?
Aw, crap. I was lettin' Todd crash in there
Probably. Did it seem kind of heavy?
That was a phone book, and I said I was sorry. How long you gonna carry that damn thing's torch.
Well, it's just kind of rude to throw a guy away. Somethin' like this might remind him of how low he's sunk.
Maybe give him a ten, show the guy you're still his bro.
Aw, DAMMIT! I said a buck, maybe a fiver, but greedy goddamn Todd rated the con at a ten. That moron.
Huh? How come?
Oh, alright. Just grab somethin' off my shelf over there.
Aw, crap.
Uh, do you want to know how to make a bomb out of a floppy disk?
Or how about the five secrets of successful shoplifting?
You really seem into this stuff!
Hold on a sec, I'm gonna get somethin' outta the garage.
Here it is, Philippe: The Anarchist's Cookbook.
As my mentor Phreak Pisces gave it to me, so I now give it to you.
NO WAY MAN
Eso ES nuestro VCR normal! No me molesta!
Todd! Find me a job, asshole.
Whoah!
Hey Pete, check it out! You seen how you can fold a twenty to show a picture of the twin towers AND the Pentagon on fire?
What was that!? Who just pulled up?
Stiv dropped Harry with a fat one to the mug and tossed him behind the couch. He didn't need the kid around for what came next.
A quick knock on the door and Uggs busted in with Thi Nhung, one of their favorites from the strip along the Ho Thien Mau docks.
Thi Nhung's belly was heavy with the cheap green tea they used on nights like this.
Nope, sorry kid.
What kind of coffin do you not care the price of?
Your own!
Why thank you. How is your mother?
This is getting FUCKING BORING!
Aw crap, this beer ain't got a twist-off! Now I gotta shame-walk all the way back to the bar!
The only reason anybody would need one is if people jerked off out the window all the time!
I got a new game for the Playstation. I'm gonna pop it in.
I had to order it from Japan--cost me forty bucks!
Where does she live?
Vegas?
I've got Vivarin and a pistol! Let's go!
Yep, just gotta cook 'em and clean 'em.
Goodnight, you Prince of the Pacific - you King of the Coast.
Oop! There goes his soul! Crap! You're not supposed to let it escape!
Huh! I'll watch out for it.
Huh? Why ya ask?
Well, uh, there's this bird, see, and there's this bee, see--
And they want a baby pretty bad, see!
They pour a bunch of magic gravy on a turkey and say spells.
Ask Cornelius, I forget.
Quit bein' a horse's ass! Hit refresh already, T!
What if it doesn't? You know how computers suck! We could be missin' some primo action!
GAH! Man, Ray's DESTROYIN'! I'm so pumped I could play a trumpet with my cock!
Let's go, man! You and me in the back yard! Last man standing!
Good luck, you commie pig!
Hey, did the Lakers win last night?
Since when does he like sports?
What, asshole?
You mean YOU gotta pack it in. I ain't afraid of some punk with an aftermarket tailpipe and a D in typing.
Cool. Guy can take all the can shots he wants of me. I got technique.
You think he'll graduate to actual toilet cams?
If he wanted you dead you'd be dead by now. He just took a picture of you on the toilet because he's weird.
Exactly.
Huh? What?
So don't tell anybody! Problem solved!
Huh? What invention?
You mean my bong?
They'd say, "Lyle! You saved the show! Your friends are all so boring, we were nearly canceled!"
"It's just tacos, guys! Hold your fire!"
Huh?
You think we can cock it up to roll joints?
You thinkin' what I'm thinkin?
Who you callin'?
Harmony and Dipitt? Those chicks cost big money! Kluxx even has flyers over the pisser at the Scow! Seriously, man, I know some broads who'd do it just for a ride to the gig.
Just don't look too close and everything'll be fine. These girls ain't "focusers."
Seriously! You want the guy to see what he's escapin', not what he's missin'.
Just put a towel over my ass and call me Marley, toots.
Philippe! You've been readin' that thing for hours!
That's right! Companies like that should suffer!
Heh! I used to work at Kmart!
I used to fill out hunting licenses for guys who couldn't write their own names!
One time I crushed my thumb in the bowling ball drill press...
...and this Vietnam vet in a wheelchair tracked my blood all the way to the bathroom!
"You got a man down," he said.
Not on the sofa, fellas.
Yeah, that one was mine to lose.
Piece 'a cake! I do time like I was pluggin' the meter!
Alright.
If I'm sick I'm at least going to enjoy it!
KILL THE LIGHT!
I heard you met some broad on the Internet!
...so?
So, do you like her?
Rent's due, low-life! Dude says he wants it by four 'cause he's goin' to the bank, you no-name jerk!
Let's see: Texas, Big Energy, political nepotism...are we talking about Enron or George W. here?
So Bush Sr. vomits on the Japanese Prime Minister, Bush Jr. asphyxiates on a pretzel...who taught these guys table manners? Millie?
I'm such a fraud
This is so empty
What are all these extra switches under the dash for? These look like custom jobs!
Like Clockwork Orange, but with more crappin' at the gas station and less eye clamps! I getcha!
So, Téodor, heard from Penny lately?
Wow!
That must be why I saw that bottle of mousse in there this morning
Gotta look good for your Penny!
Look what I found on eBay!
Let me watch your chat. I'll tell you if she likes you.
Yeah. Go for it.
Hmm. She seems happy to see you again.
A reference to something you said last time!
Yeah. Now tell her that you like long, deep kisses with the eyes wide open. Chicks love that.
Halloween's comin' up, squirt--- you got a costume picked out?
A boy princess? How's that work? Like, little underpants with a banana in the front?
And I could be mean to you guys! Princesses always got a wicked stepmom or somethin'!
You suck, chica! You'll never finish sweepin' before the prince marries that jota from Kinko's!
I'm havin' Todd over for spaghetti dinner and ipecac pilates at seven. Science don't get paid to rest, son.
Dammit!
The cholo cooks at my new busin' gig load me down with tons of leftovers every night ... I got frijoles and tortillas comin' outta my ears!
You wanna get in on the ground floor, here?
Listen, I need to borrow some money.
Sangria?
Is that right.
Didn't Snoopy have a Mexican cousin?
Spike was a pretty lousy character. Didn't he sleep in a cactus?
Nice going. What's for dinner then?
That stuff sends oyster shit down my throat.
Makes me puke.
Wow, 10 knives for $19.99?!
It FELL through that onion, man.
Your basal nervous system wants these knives!
I think my heart's explodin'! THESE KNIVES!
Oh, just doin' my homework on the gonzo biz. Got a couple UK titles to check out.
I'm makin' enchiladas. You want any?
Sure.
Alright, Laphroaig's empty! What's switch number four do?
Lemme guess... it's a recessed gun that pops up and shoots a big doily onto parkin' spaces!
Hey, I'm gettin' a call! It's Ray!
'sup, Ray? You find Philippe yet? Threadville quarry? Yeah, we just passed it! Ok, see you in two!
We're fucked, babe. Gator beat town with all the gear from the cabinet shop.
I'm just sayin', two guys are in a band, usually both of 'em get to help write songs. Gimme a shot, man.
Well, yeah. Basically.
Shower's busted. Got a job interview.
What's with the fruit boots?
Why'd you make me look fat, T?
SHUT UP! Shut up, both of you! God, I've never wanted to start a joint company less in my life!
KILL THE LIGHT!
Yeah, what didja see?
I promise to look at cathedrals in a library book next time I get the chance.
What are you doing, Téodor?
Your website sucks! I can't read anything over that obnoxious background image.
Why don't you just get rid of that stupid background image?
I AM in hell, when I look at your website!
And what graveyard did you get that dancing baby out of?
What is bisalivary?
What are clown jokes!
The...oh, crap. Uh, the person who invented Halloween?
FUCK!
Is that Oregon Trail?! Man, I used to PUNISH at this game!
Let's see here...got to outfit my wagon, get some oxen, shoe the horses...
Holy Hallelujah! I don't remember this part! "I'll take a whiskey."
"Pound the whiskey!"
Hey, if you're offerin'! "Yes!"
Ha ha!
Dunno. Found it inna sink with some dried noodles in it.
Shampooin' Téodor! You don't cut dry hair, dude.
Business was slow!
As you know, last week's strips were mainly about wieners and boners.
Education.
Huh? How come?
Oh, alright. Just grab somethin' off my shelf over there.
Aw, crap. Uh... do you want to know how to make a bomb out of a floppy disk?
Or how about the five secrets of successful shoplifting?
You really seem into this stuff! Hold on a sec. I'm gonna get somethin' outta the garage.
Here it is, Philippe: The Anarchist's Cookbook. As my mentor Phreak Pisces gave it to me, so I now give it to you.
Welcome home, fellas. What'll it be?
Bah! Those crooks!
Did you guys know the real Jared died at a Subway in 1998?
The franchise owner stole his pants, and hired an actor named Dennis J. Carmichael to assume the identity of his "diet miracle boy". I don't need to tell you how he disposed of the body.
Yo.
Why do you suck so much at getting us anywhere?
Gar-motherfuckin'-field! Man, I'll never get used to seein' you outta makeup.
Yeah, man. We do a mean one. Dildo it for you? Only a buck.
No worries. Union?
Sure, alright.
Aww HELL yeah!
Ray-- Hey loser! You wouldn't wake up so we ditched you. We'll be back late. You're an idiot,  Lyle.
Like what?
Ahhh... the story of a kid leavin' the magic of childhood behind and growin' up.
You ever hear the B-side?
Yeah, it's called...
WELCOME TO YOUR THIRTIES!
That's just a watered-down ringtone-style clip. Lemme know if you ever wanna hear the rest - I'll get some hammers and meet you in the backyard. Don't forget to bring your dreams.
One!
What are you readin' about Phillipe? Some sissy book? A book about sissy stuff?
Let's not talk about this ever again. Don't tell nobody, all right?
What kind of stuff you want me to play? Fast? Slow? Major? Minor?
Alright, I gotcha.
Kill the flashlight!
Holy Moses does this book stink!
Tell it to the pipes, pal.
Hey, what's this? Cursive?
Dude - no.
He's a ninety-seven year old rookie! He's just gonna cough a bunch and then go on and on about the time he saw Duke Ellington in a magazine!
Heh! Nah, but that'd be a pretty cool creation myth!
I'll see YOU two groin idiots...LATER!
So Rustmouth got back his rightful seat at the top of the blues pile?
Wow. Bird out-bluesed him every step of the way.
Jeez, I don't think there's a wrap-up story! I could make a killing!
Shame to waste some Chucks.
You read Ralph Rene's book, Emeril?
Tell that guy he sucks!
What did you just say?!
DUDE! You want the edges to be blunt, so if it hits your head it makes it explode!
You listen to me! The more of your head explodes, the faster you're outta your misery! Who cares what happens next?
YOU RICH BASTARDS ARE SO HUNG UP ON YOUR GODDAMN DECORUM YOU FORGET WHAT MATTERS!
Jesus Christ! I set this beer down for five minutes and you popped it, you fug?
That was my REWARD beer, you bastard! It's IMPORTED!
Wake up, turd!
HEY! I don't like kickin' asleep dudes' asses, but I'll do it! I know how!
I dunno! Let's get the hell outta here!
Kung Fu? Yeah, sure. But it's real hard to learn Kung Fu. And the lessons cost a bundle.
Yeah, I could get into Kung Fu. But I'm already pretty set with my own fighting style.
I just fight, man. I fight like crazy!
Hey! Our jive-asshole cartoonist couldn't write an ending for this pointless strip! Looks like It's time to hit the road!
Stay hard, Miami.
Hey! OASIS!
Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! You know who you are!
Don't give me that look! I'll come over there and slap the scowls right off your faces, so help me!
Can it! I brought you some more beer. DON'T WRITE ANY SONGS! I'm serious!
hrgh.
Not guilty, your Honor. I was just tryin' to hang a Larry when all of a sudden my...my arm got caught in the steerin' wheel. I never meant to flip a bitch.
I...I was sober, sir. I don't know how any of that information can be considered actual.
Hey, kid. I'm an asshole. Your parents around?
Kill the flashlight!
I'm gettin' up there in years.
It's your lucky day, T!
Sorry, hoss. Time for my man-douche.
I call any bottle that has a handle.
You think I'm joking? I'm not! I want a huge amount to drink.
Téodor! Open up! I can't feel my sack!
'Cause that's all we drive, chump!
Hey, man. Cuppa joe?
Sure thing, pal.
Alright, that's forty-seven.
I'm gonna have to see the cash up front.
Lemme know if I shit myself. Excellent.
Yeah, that one was mine to lose.
