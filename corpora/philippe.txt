I still think it would be fun if Todd was my vice president!
Yeah, I think everybody wishes they could fly. It's impossible, though.
What?
Okay, but only if you think you're brave enough!
Ha ha! What show is this?
Ha ha!
Hi Lyle!
Oh no! Alligators! Run, everybody!
But don't worry, they're not too fast on land--
OH MY GOD THEY'RE SO FAST
Oh no! Why are my legs moving so slow?!
HEEELLLP!
Wha--? What's happening?
Will you turn on the lights please Billy?
Téodor, what's the worst name in the world?
Cool! Thanks!
How fun!
Mr. Bear?
Better not... too risky...
Ouch... Ouch... Ouch... Ouch...
Who ate all the honey-roasted peanuts I left on the coffee table?! I was looking forward to having some when I came inside!
Al Pacino is in Téodor's room?! Oh my gosh!
Oh boy. I couldn't ask Al Pacino to pay me back for eating those peanuts! He would think I was small-time!
Oh, uh...Mozart! I want to be smart like Mozart!
All done!
It's not?
Oh! I see!
Maybe I'll just hold my breath until I die!
This isn't working at all!
Saaaay, why's the couch in the front hallway? Crazy!
What do you mean? It's going to someone else's house?
They're throwing it awway?! Nooo! NOO! They can't!
It's been here since I have! I always play and read my books on it!
If we throw it away it will feel so hurt and lonely!
b...bye couch...I love you! I'll always remember you!
Téodor, where do you think they took the couch today?
Let's see... sheriff's bady, pork and beans, ladle... all set!
I don't get it, Billy! How come I have to say so many cusses?
Lie Bot, what is the saddest thing?
I...I think so, this time.
Yes. I agree.
Nooo!
Really?
Oh boy!
You have to hit it to this end!
Huuugs!
huuuuugs
Wow, a banjo! Will you play me a song, Téodor? Please? Pretty pleeease!
Oh boy oh boy! Can I look now?
I wonder if Mr. Wizard ever boiled shit! I better go on YouTube!
Mr Bear, I think I have a stomach ache.
What? Why?
I guess I did...
EEEAUGH!
I'll just tell her that I'm married. No one can argue with that.
What's checkers?
Checkers is hard!
Is this good enough, Lie Bot?
There has never been any money in my pockets ever!
Here.
Philippe! See, that's me.
Now it's your turn.
Frances! What a pretty name!
Will you marry me, Frances?
FRANCES! Why isn't the baby breathing?! Can't you hear me? Frances! WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING?!
Pat, what's evaporation?
Hey! How come Mr. Bear is lying down?
Wow, twenty thousand! I better get a stopwatch to help him keep track!
How come you're looking out the window so much today, Téodor?
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll go to my room.
Yeah! It never happened! Lyle can prove it!
But Ray!
Cowboys!
There you go! What do you think?
Ha ha! I guess you do look just like a skater!
Wow!
They put a drinking fountain for dogs in the bathroom! What a neat decision!!
Huh? What's a bidet?
Like...in a mean way?
Oh...I see. Well, here goes nothing. I guess. If I mess up and get too mean, You can have my Action Rangers.
What, Mr. Bear?
It's Democrats and Republicans, right?
Which one's better?
Why don't they just make one party out of all the good things?
Oooh! Merry Christmas, Téodor!
Oh boy oh boy!
OOOFFF
oh boy
Here . . . All I got for you guys was this picture that I drew . . . Merry Christmas. . .
Lie Bot, how does Chinese Water Torture work?
Oh my gosh!
"M-M-Molly, c-c-can I ask you a question about Jesus?"
"If Jesus was a dog, would he wear a cape and walk on two legs?"
"Oh boy!"
"Wow! You are a good artist, Molly! Can we show that he has been eating chocolate?"
Okay!
Hello, dear Pope! Would you like a seat near the window?
Start a fire for the pope, at once!
You're absolutely right, dear Pope! I am dedicated to improving morals!
You may NOT speak about my mother that way! Pope, you are no longer welcome in my country!
Yes!
Well! What a fancy drawing of a cow with dotted lines separating all the main steaks! A very nice present!
I wonder what I would look like in a diagram like that...
Téodor, what happens to animals' faces after we eat their meat parts?
Cool!
Okay! Say ideas!
Italian people are nice!
There should be a place where they can shave and go potty!
Hi Ray! We need to take care of homeless people!
And they win a free George Foreman grill!
Sheesh! You people are pretty disappointing! Not even ONE of you raised your hand!
They told me you'd be scary and dangerous! The only thing scary about YOU is that your teeth have scabs!
a-HEM! Everyone I live with says that ladies should wear bras, even if their boobs are crummy!
We can do a lot better around here, people! Worst... dumps...EVER!
It is a perfect... logo!
UGGH! STUPID FRIDGE! STUPID HEAVY FRIDGE! STUPID JERK FRIDGE!
I'm coming, couch! I still love you! People care about you! You were always our friend! You matter!
Wow! Can you show me how to blow bubbles too, Téodor?
Whatcha' doin', Mr. Bear?
Oh! Do you mean like if a beatnik who isn't proud of himself wants to talk to you, so first he says, "So, cat...a rap: all it rot"?
Oh gosh, I wouldn't call it an ability. It's just somethin' I can do. "Crib bickerer!"
Wow, you like this stuff? For real?
Mom, guess what! I'm calling you from a pay phone...
and I didn't even have to pay for it!
I used an Anarchy Box!
Yeah! And we used ground-up aspirin and lemon juice to erase the postmarks!
I re-used the stamps to send you some pictures that I drew!
Lyle also taught me how to make a fake ID!
I made you one that says you're 65 so you can get the retirement breakfast at Denny's!
Ha ha! Don't thank me, thank Anarchy!
You didn't have to lie to him! He was so nice to us!
Ray! Look! The police are at your house!
Be careful, Ray! There might be machine guns!
Oh boy! I wonder how many ladies wrote back to Roast Beef!
I better tell him to get his dancing pants on!
[[stares at the computer. Displayed in a giant monitor window with scroll bars behind him is the following information
C'mon stupid old car! Start! START!
Yes!
Mr. Bear, who's better - Emeril or Jesus?
Because Jesus could turn loaves into fishes and feed a thousand people, but Emeril feeds that many people every day at his restaurant!
I'm more confused than before!
Oh no! Stupid deer! Why did you have to be out in the road?! Oh no oh no oh no.
Oh my gosh!
He's trying to get away... I guess I would too
Ray, can I have fifty cents for a Skor bar from the vending machine?
But you just ate one! I saw!
You had a Three Musketeers and you were sticking peanuts into it!
They do?
Chinese people are amazing.
Oh boy! It looks just like my drawing! Thank you, Lyle!
Wow!
Did you get the horn to work the way we talked about?
Hey!
Don't make my car call me a fag! That is very rude!
Lyle! Hey! Where did you go to?!
Oh, brother! I can't drive around in a car that calls me a fag! It will cause problems in the community!
I learned five jokes!
Is Antiques Road Show on?
Oh no! They found a dead person!
They never find a dead person on Antiques Road Show.
On Antiques Road show they look at a picture or a vase and then they tell the person that is worth so much money that they will always be happy forever.
They never find a dead person with a wrench in his head.
What...what are mega-nerds?
Oh! So that's what Téodor was doing!
I don't think so. Lyle's in the garage, but he's throwing up spaghetti.
Wow! Cool!
Lie Bot, what is the saddest thing?
Nooo!
Look Lyle! My mom got me an electric guitar!
Stop it! It's totally rad! Just listen!
What? Now you want to climb a tree? You sure have a lot of dreams for a french fry!
Well, how do you like it up here?
Yeah, I guess it is pretty scary
Ha ha! Yeah, of course you can!
I'm not coming down until I lose ten pounds!
Will you put all the dressings into bowls with different ladles?
Can we listen to the Ford Trucks song?
Do...do you have any... Vicodin?
From...from when you had your...wisdom teeth out?
I don't even want Vicodin, Todd! All I want is nachos!
It's just a general purpose meeting so we can meet each other.
Do you think you can make some cakes and hamburgers and stuff?
At first I thought tacos would be fun, but that's probably what he'll have on the plane ride up.
Oh! We should also make sure he wipes his shoes before he comes in the house.
How about Todd?
Todd's funny.
Everyone likes Todd!
Let's use Todd!
Oh no! I'm under attack by cods! Oh my goodness!
They're probably six feet long!
GO AWAY! GO AWAY STUPID CODS!
GO AWAY!
I must be on the spout of a giant whale! When he stops blowing, I'll fall hundreds of feet and break my neck!
How come I'm not falling? Am I on a cloud? What if...what if I died and I'm in heaven? Maybe God lets you skip the scary part of dying...I should thank him if he has time to meet with me...
I...I just wanted to say thank you for being God and for making my life good! I'll miss it, but I'm glad I'm here with You.
Wow! Thank you for the free toothbrush! Oh my gosh, it even has your phone number on the side! That way I can Consult you in times of crisis!
Huh!
Wow! Neat!
LYLE! You did potty on my very last kids' book!
Say you're sorry! This one was my favorite!
If you can do a good job, that would be nice.
Oh boy! I sure hope Cunty wins the town race! That's the only way the Mayor won't turn his pond into an apartment for ungrateful people!
Oh my goodness! How convenient!
Hey! Don't touch the Sex Bicycle, Todd.
You'd better believe that I have wicked sack, Todd.
Um... Okay...
Suck it, old man.
Really, Lie Bot?
Could he even be in the computer?
Phew!
Magnum P.I.!
*thinking* Boy, is this guy talky! When are we gonna get to the Super-Secret Ice Cream Shop already?!
Lyle's cussing!
He's cussing!
He's just cussing!
No cussing!
No I didn't!
Oh! Good! I can do installments!
I think
Wait a minute, I have no way of ever getting any money!
Maybe I should commit suicide!
oof
Oh boy! I can sit with you guys?
Yo mama's so fat, she broke her leg and hot bloody fat sprayed everywhere! Some even got on the mayor!
Téodor: Orezscu is a friend of mine and he knows a ton about music! He said he would like to help me out with the Friday Facts page more in the future so maybe he will. What is "blew"?
Don't litter, Lyle!
Hi Mr. Bear!
I need to find the Q-tips.
Lyle's record player needs cleaning...a-ha!
See you later!
I should start a newspaper!
Lyle, do you want to write for my newspaper?
Hi Roast Beef! Do you want to write for my newspaper?
Oh, boy!
Heya, Lie Bot! Wanna watch me dig a hole?
Really!?
That's marvelous!
Oh my gosh! I'll get tortured!
Maybe digging this hole wasn't such a good idea after all.
So, are you RoughBoy99 or pants_come_off?
I have nice gray hair and I like to program on my computer.
I just got shot by my best friend but the good news is that now I have the Internet in my brain!
I am looking for someone...
Hm! I wonder what kind of lady Roast Beef would like to meet?
I am looking for someone who would like to hear about my trip into OUTER SPACE!
Pranks?
But that's mean! What if it hit him?
I don't want to be mean to Pat!
Hey, that's RIGHT!
I can do that!
Okay. What will that do?
Wow! What is THIS thing?
A DOLL insert? Cool! What could it make a doll do? The splits?
What does it do, Téodor?
It is a perfect... logo!
Good job, everyone!
I don't mind! Everybody should get a turn!
But, mother! Without the contribution of the entire cast, Achewood wouldn't be the unique blend of humor and camaraderie that we all know and love!
Please mommy I'm sorry for being disrespectful please not the BUCKLE MOMMY NOT THE BUCKLE!
Ultra Peanut! Is that you?
I...I'm sorry! I thought you were mad at me because of what I did to Click Robot!
Wow! He's sassy!
Ow! Ow! He's stinging me! It's really hot!
Hello, America. Good Morning. How are you.
I think everyone is disappointed by the failures of the current administration.
I think everyone wants to see some new ideas!
And, i think everyone agrees it's time this country was run by someone who is five!
It's official that I put my hand over my heart on the way up, right?
Hm. Which will be a better raft to take to the barge?
I bet that cooler would float pretty good. Plus it has neat stuff on it like Dale Jr.'s car!
Better take the old fridge, though. That will be stronger in case cods or seals try to bite at me.
Bye bye Stanley!
My ear hurts, Roast Beef! Since yesterday!
Oh my gosh! I could go deaf? Oh noooooo!
YEAH! HA HA HA! VERY GOOD!
MY FATHER ONCE KNEW A MAN!
Heh! Oh, Lyle. You big hot tranny mess.
Heh! Oh, Beef. You big hot tranny mess.
Oh, Ray. That tee shot was just a big hot tranny mess.
Hello? Oh, hi mom! How are you? Huuugs!
Yeahhh, I think I might be a little taller... So what's new at home?
But...but you don't need anybody new! You already love Dad! I know he's in Heaven now! But...but...
What, Mr. Bear?
It's Democrats and Republicans, right?
Which one's better?
Why don't they just make one party out of all the good things?
Saaaay, why's the couch in the front hallway? Crazy!
What do you mean? It's going to someone else's house?
They're throwing it away?! Nooo! NOO! Thay can't!
It's been here ever since I have! I always play and read my books on it!
If we throw it away it will feel so hurt and lonely!
b...bye couch...I love you! I'll always remember you!
Téodor, where do you think they took the couch today?
Let's see...sheriff's badge, pork and beans, ladle...all set!
What did you get Téodor for his birthday?
I got him a Stomper!
Because of a problem?
Why not, Lie Bot?
But how come?
Oh...oh no! Is...do you think the flower is mad with me?!
I'm sorry flower!
I do.
One minute!
Does UNIX have eBay?
What did you say, french fry?
Of course it's fun to be able to walk!
What?
Hmmm. I could put you in a rollerskate...would you like that?
I... I just wanted to hear him make his bathroom sound again!
I'm sorry! Oh no! I'm so sorry!
Oh my gosh! Did he not die all the way? Do you have to finish killing him?
Is... is he in pain?
I... I'm sorry I dishonored you, Click Robot!
Yes!
Noooo!
What are you reading, Lyle?
Oh boy! The Advisor answered my letter! Oh, good!
But I thought men couldn't have babies!
Yes!
Wow! Is it a boy or a girl?! Is it okay? What is its name?
Oh my gosh, guys! Thanks!
Lie Bot, do other people really want to kill Americans?
How come?
I don't have a big vocabulary.
I think so
Jeez, Billy... sometimes I think I might be the worst person for your soul to be in! I don't seem to know anything about punk rock!
No I'm not! I'm not punk at ALL!
Well sure, I guess so...
I guess one time my mom told me I had to stop reading my favorite book and go to bed and in my head I thought up a real sad piano song that I would ask my best friend to play at my funeral...
I even tried to get the last notes to sound like,
Hiya, Lie Bot!
Oh, I dunno. Extra stuff?
AAAA!
AAAAAAA!
Lyle, will you read me a bedtime story?
I just saw Harry Potter and I'm too scared to go to sleep!
Oh wow! Really?!
Oh boy! Wow!
Ray?
Is today Todd's birthday?
How come?
Oh no! Will he have to pay a fee?
TODD!
Why do I have to get a job, Lie Bot?
But I can't get a job! I don't know how to do anything!
That... that was an accident! I didn't know that you can't touch flowers!
What?! What do you mean?
I have to get married?! But I'm only five!
HEEE
EEEEE
ELLL
LLLLP!
Oh boy! It's Friday! Egg and cheese muffin day!
I'm -
oh NO! I haven't done this since I was a little kid! What's the matter with me?!
What if it's a lifelong problem? I'll have to move out to the desert and be a hermit!
I want to be a comedian! Mr. Bear, how do I come up with my own jokes?
Huh! Okay, how about this...
"They say that eating an apple a day keeps the doctor away ... but throwing it at him works better!"
"They say that genius is ninety-nine percent perspiration, so I wrote to Stephen Hawking and asked that he never come and sit on any of our couches!"
"I went to a doctor for help getting rid of my athelete's foot, but they just yanked it away and threw me in jail..."
"I truly believe that there is somebody out there for everyone ... just standing there ... waiting for the house to go dark..."
You write your own Harry Potter legends TOO?! Can I see? You can read mine!
But I--
What do you mean?
Yeah...
Yeah.
Phew!
I really thought that flower was pregnant!
I mean, it sorta makes sense... all the pollen and stuff, and that birds and bees story...
Surely you can see how a guy could get confused!
You think I'm funny?
Ha ha! Yeah, I guess I am a little retarded!
"What's a guy to do!"
I guess that I'm retarded But what's a guy to do-
I like to marry things I find I'm glad that I found you!
Téodor, how do you say "potatoes"?
--oh my goodness! Is this...the olympics?
Superman wouldn't wear a police hat in the shower! Applesauce!
Oh boy! Are we having cracked crab for dinner tonight, Lyle!
My favorite!
Cracked crab dance! Cracked crab dance!
Crab! Crab! Did you want to be friends?!
Oh boy! My mom sent me an I Am Capable Of Wonderful Things doll!
You're welcome!
Ahem. Baby Llewellyn cannot eat a carrot for several years.
One...two...three...
Is this okay?
Ray, you old punter! How's about a fag for your old mate?
Are you saying that my pants are ridiculous? The only thing ridiculous around here is what you're gonna look like when I cut your trolley off!
You know! Your cabbages and cod!
Your nose and spectacles, man! Your balls and pencil!
Your Cain and Abels?
Your Peter, Paul and Larry?
Can you peek at my newest ideas? I...I'm gonna...I'll be right back.
Talk about fresh!
What should he do? A good writer would know this.
Ha ha!
Siiick!
You are so ARROGANT!
Lile, what is the story of the birds and the bees?
I think I heard on a TV show that it explains where babies come from!
Oh, I see! Thanks, Lyle!
How obvious!
Wait a minute! Where do they get the baby?
What are the spells?
Mr. Bear, what spell do you say to turn a turkey into a new baby boy or girl?
Fajinal...vandig...gul...what?
Sperm! Oh, you mean Magic Gravy!
W-Why?
That's right, Pat! I would like to earn your vote!
Good! What issue would you like to chat about?
Gay folks?
What?
What are you talking about? What is Homosexuals? That sounds like the name of a famous circus gorilla!
Ladies and Gentlemen, please put your hands together for Homosexuals the Gorilla!
Hey! He can be my political party mascot! Just like how Democrats have a donkey!
Oh boy!
This is turning out good!
Excuse me, Lie Bot. I have to use the bathroom.
What?
Oh, I see!
No!
Okay!
Yaaaay!
No opinion!
And today in Sports! ...ahem... Washington safety Curtis Williams always smiled, even confined to a wheelchair, paralyzed from the neck down...
These are my new Speaker Sneakers! My mom sent them to me!
Watch!
Lyle! Are you going into your room to smoke heated-up marijuana?
That's illegal!
I don't need to! Everyone in the house can smell when you do it even though you have that dumb invention that you think works!
That little tube you try to hide the smoke in! I saw you do it once!
What if C.O.P.S. came and everyone was yelling at you? You'd feel bad then!
I am not boring! I learned how to cook tacos today!
Can you please please PLEASE turn the lights on?! I'm scared of the dark!
I'm sorry! Please don't be mad! I didn't know!
I have to get to the transfer station! I have to...I have to find my friend!
H-How come?
Who's they?
W-What do you collect?
I can't believe I won the competition to meet the Beach Boys. They're my favourite band in the whole world.
Wow yes please I mean, if I could!
Carl, Al and big brother Brian are practising their harmonies. All sounding nice!
Now where could Dennis be?
Hmm...
Aaaiiiiie!
What's a Stem Cell?
Oh boy!
These are delicious!
Pprk chops with applesauce?
Nooo!
Shriek!
Lie Bot, what is the saddest thing?
Nooo!
The Anarchy Cookbook is amazing!
Did you know that McDonald's is the best place to use counterfeit money?
It's because no one there cares what is happening!
And you can create fun explosions at Kmart by filling the paint shaker up with big bottles of soda!
What? Really? You did?
Wow!
Listen! A fire truck! What do you think happened, Lie Bot?
Gosh! Do you think so?
Whoah! What's happening to me?
Oh boy! What's it for?
Oh, boy! Maybe we can solve a crime!
Gosh, how do you commit suicide? Maybe if I eat lots of super-hot chili sauce...
or take way too hot of a shower?
I know!
I'll pour boiling gravy into my eyes! That oughta do me in!
What do you mean, Ray?
Otters are lactose intolerant...
Can you make it not have the milk part?
Yes! And I wrote down everything she did so you would have an idea!
No, she was pretty sleepy. Oh! She also farted seven times. See, here. I made kind of a little graph of each one.
I could barely hear the second one but I figured better safe than sorry, right?
I...I think I heard it. I'm...I mean I'm not...
I...oh no! I'm not sure!
I'M SO SORRY!
Téodor! What happened? Where am I?
The...the couch! We need to save our old couch! It's on the barged headed for china!
But...but it trusted us, and it was always there for us, and we threw it away!
O...okay.
Yeah...
Holy mackerel, that's right!
Gosh! This was the couch's plan all along! That guy!
Oh, you aren't kidding! He was amazing!
Aw, why learn Chinese just to go bug a guy! Let's don't and say we did!
Téodor! I'd like to talk with you about my campaign!
I need your vote, but I want to EARN it!
Ahem.
Did you know that every night, people all across America go to bed sad?
Yes.
I will give every American a little puppy dog named Mr. Poopytime!
It is my firm belief that little puppy dogs named Mr. Poopytime will bring our nation together!
Wow! What's that?
Neat! What's he do?
Wow, that sounded kind of cute!
Can...can he do it again?
I don't want to wait four hours!
Let's see-how'd she do that...
ah, here we go-"Make Bathroom".
"OK".
Oh my gosh! Click Robot! Stop! No!
Knock knock!
A screaming person!
A screaming person out in the street!
Hi Téodor! One custom baseball card of me, please!
Yarr! There be hugs and kisses this way!
Who be wantin' to know!
Do you work at the circus?!
Do a trick! Pleeease!
Wow, seven dollars!
It's so soft! It's like having a new baby lamb!
I will love you forever, seven dollars!
You are seven dollars! Yes you ARE! Yes you ARE!
I'm sorry that I didn't like you, little guy.
It's the Little Kid Message Board! It's the message board where kids can say what kids have to say!
In there!
Okay. Boy, I sure wish Todd didn't do all those cocaines.
Hooray! Thank you!
You must be Santa's dad!
Oh, wow! Just like all the tough guys have!
Look, Téodor! Pretty cool, huh? Just like Bruce Willis!
Téodor! Let me help you get up!
Gosh!
There! Everybody likes Harry Potter!
Christmas is an exciting time for me, Philippe. I like to imagine the presents that Santa Claus will bring me.
I put out a vodka Martini for him, and some nachos! I like to think he will like these things.
I am not sure why Santa Claus is so kind.
Perhaps he is trying to atone for crimes he did earlier in life.
Like snapping off a Q-tip in a school friend's ear.
REALLY?!
What? What's the problem, Lie Bot?
Oh no! If I take office, it will be like murdering Mickey Mouse!
No. I can't let him do it. What's the number of the radio show?
Don't shoot yourself, Mickey! I will let George Bush be the President again!
Oh boy! What a fun idea!
Hello! I am the toilet!
Nobody should smoke!
There is a sale on Cadillacs!
Yes! I finally get to sleep in my old bed with the big ropy afghan and see dad's wooden ship model that's on the bookcase again!
...yeah. He was a really fun guy, but I guess he didn't live healthy. All mom says is that he "went on his own terms."
Oh, boy! 'Course I do! I can see the hot pork chops on 'em now!
Oh my gosh! HOOOME! I can't wait to get home again!
SSSH!
but today I am ending the Mafia.
Oh no!
Phew!
I get VERY nice on this stuff.
Maybe I should pray to Jesus and the Lord that the bed will be dry tomorrow! That's what Mom would say to do.
Dear God and Jesus,
I know that I peed in the bed last night. I am sure that this was part of your plan for me.
I have learned from this lesson. I will work hard to improve my life and the lives of others.
I will make meals for the homeless.
I will volunteer at rest homes, and help the elderly.
I'll watch movies with burn victims, and mist their eyes if they don't have any eyelids left.
Actually, instead of that last one I could just help at the library or something.
My mom sent them to me. I haven't been seeing well.
Okay
I don't know any of those words.
Who's Catullus?
I'll tell you if you tell me where they take the old couches!
What barge? Where?
Ray! Mark Twain doesn't want to know about that kind of thing! Be polite!
Yes! Good!
Oh! Yes! I'm going to be a princess!
Princess Philippe and Underpants Dan are gonna save...
... the WORLD!
Good point! We'd better go... to the DOCTOR!
Say! He could be my sidekick, like Ariel and Sebastian!
Oh, boy! Let's practice!
Don't listen to him, Dan!
This is my Halloween costume!
What does this make?
I fold
...flower, do you take me, Phillippe, to be your lawfully wedded---
He knows!
PETUNIA; the "TouchmeNot"; IRRESISTIBLE; "Pregnant with your child"; DIABETES
W-Why not?
Goodnight!
Good Morning!
How come there aren't any people at my wedding?
Where?
You did?
Hello Thigh Bone!
Nice to meet you Small Talk!
Hi guys!
Ha ha! Hi Mr. Bear!
Who's on your show today?
Hello, this is Philippe! I am happy to talk to you!
Please take our number off your list. Goodbye.
Mr. Bear, what would happen if a chicken mated with a dog?
If a chicken mated with a dog! You know! What would happen?
No, I mean what would the baby look like?
Oh. So not like this drawing?
Shucks. It would be the perfect pet! The un-bitey-ness of a chicken's head, and the "I don't want to cook that"-ness of a dog's body! Everyone would be safe!
Ray, what does it mean that Pat is gay?
Yeah! Scared but important!
Wow! Like people who can see ghosts, or the future! There should be a movie about Pat's ability!
This is turning out great!
Huh.
Téodor! Mr. Bear read My Side of the Mountain to me! I'm going to live on my own in the backyard!
Saaa-a-ay! How come your thingy is stickin' out like a screwdriver handle? Mine never did that yet!
Keeps you from wetting the bed?! I need to find some medicine that makes my thingy fat!
Wow, I'll bet.
Yeah! With the orange light that says it's ready!
You don't say!
Sounds tasty.
Well, I bet mom cooks me her famous pork chops with hot asparagus and buttered rice! She makes the best pork chops in the whole WORLD!
I always had that with cold Acidophilus milk! Boy, what a great drink to-
Yeah sure! 'Course! Anyways, after that, we always have a scoop of fifty-fifty! That's orange and vanilla ice cream where the flavors are in stripes and...
Cornelius! A pleasing dance for King Phillipe, at once!
It's mine! I bought it! I paid a thousand smackaroos!
That's not true! A guy from the internet gave me a thousand bucks to have dinner with him!
I get more money from sending him letters that he can read in the bathroom!
Who am I going to meet? Is it somebody famous? Is it Emeril?
Yes mom! I was just about to play them.
I bet so!
I like life!
I, PHILIPPE, LIKE LIFE!
She?
I'm going to meet a lady?
Oh boy!
Hello?
Ladies and Gentlemen, I command your attention!
AHEM... Tonight is a new beginning! tonight is the first night of...
Cüddlenacht!
Hello! I need a hug! Wake up! Do you have Dora? I can't visit animals because there is a lice alert! I need to poop! I have a joke about a canary: He was hanging upside-down! Ha ha! Does God have a car?
Hi Vlad!
Really?!
Who?
Wow!
I want to be on the Wall of Tough Guys!
Wink!
I don't want him to waste the ticket.
Yaaay! Done!
Hi Ray!
Téodor is taking a nap.
Lie Bot! What are you doing in that bush?
Sounds good! I'll be inside if you need me.
Oh boy! It came!
Watch!
I'm studying about my family!
I know! It's important!
Oh, better make it five! I was going to take some of the neighborhood kids to breakfast before work.
Oh! Better take me with you. I want to pray.
Mr. Bear, what will the rest of my life be like?
Wow, I get to take a shower with a band? Totally cool!
Thank you Roast Beef!
I just exercised and ate healthy!
Oh, I don't know...
Oh boy!
Geology Greg from City College Community Minute says that marshes are where land and water meet! I'll just follow the creek!
Boy, this creek goes on for EVER! I better start camping before it gets too late!
Oh, shoot! I forgot a can opener for the pork and beans.
What am I supposed to eat?
Ohhh g-g-gosh... s-s-sooo c-cold... s-s-sooo hungry...
I want a chainsaw! I want a chainsaw NOW! Everybody has a chainsaw but ME!
You're MAD at me! SHAME on you!
Téodor! Guess what I learned today!
No! Lie Bot taught me how to do a break-dance move! Watch!
RAP MUSIC, MY DROOGS!
But I thought you were a "Cyber-punk," Billy! How come you're scared of Chucklebot?
Well how come you used to call yourself a "Cyber-punk," then?
You called yourself a "Cyber-punk" just because you had an e-mail address?
But Billy Idol! Why did your soul go into me?
What do you want me to do, Billy?
It bothered you, and it bothered us.
We're into education now.
Lyle, will you read me a bedtime story?
I just saw Harry Potter and I'm too scared to go to sleep.
These don't sound like bedtime stories! Don't you know any?
Oh wow! Really?!
Oh boy! Wow!
Wow! What's this Ray?
Let's pretend it works!
Oh boy!
Let's...let's see when Santa Claus was born!
Hooray!
My weird neighbor came by and started shooting her mouth off... now she has to eat through a tube in her arm...
Speaking of shooting... Sure, it's easy to shoot fish in a barrel, but I prefer to shoot fish in a tuxedo. I think people appreciate that extra level of professionalism.
Instead of dessert, English people call it "pudding." This works really well if you're trying to lose weight.
They tell us not to judge a book by its cover, but what if the building's on fire? Don't be a hero, man - just do it and get out.
Women are born with all the eggs they'll ever have, but cockroaches are born pregnant... I think we know who's winning that game...
Well, now! What language is that you're speaking?
Maybe you can write it down!
NO!
Yes! Yes!
I promise!
Why not, Lie Bot?
But how come?
Oh... oh no! Is... do you think the flower is mad with me?
It's such a good song! It's what America is all about!
Huh. Well, that's no fun! Let's rewrite it!
"Born...in the USA! I went to school and got an...A! I ate a hamburger and said Hooray!"
Christmas is an exciting time for me, Philippe. I like to imagine the presents that Santa Claus will bring me.
I put out a vodka Martini for him, and some nachos! I like to think he will like these things.
I am not sure why Santa Claus is so kind. Perhaps he is trying to atone for crimes he did earlier in life. Like snapping off a Q-tip in a school friend's ear.
huuuuugs
Hello! I am happy to talk to---
Hello?
Who's there?
Is it... is it Jesus?
Am... Am I... dead?
Oh well. At least I have had a good life.
It's from mom!
Oh boy! It's Walk-Around-Butt!
I can't wait to try it out! YES!
Walk-Around Butt! When you wear it, you're a nut!
Walk-Aroouuund...
BUTT!
See warranty for details. Not intended for children over nine.
Hi Mom! Thank you for Walk-Around Butt! It's perfect!
No, I did not, mom!
Pistachios!
Good!
But I don't even have my learner's permit and I maybe don't think I can fit inside Todd's van...
Todd, I need to go left! I need to go left! What do I do?
BROWN COUCH! BROWN COUCH! BROWN COUCH! PAY ATTENTION!
Hm. I DO feel pretty bad that I don't know very much about piano music. This might be a good opportunity.
OK. I am interested in getting piano CDs.
Yes it is. Okay, I look forward to receiving the piano music in a few days.
Aww, I don't suppose I should ask for nothin'! Life's been pretty good to me.
Ooh! What?
Dear God: for my birthday, please let Ray not be afraid of heights any more. He is my friend, and I promise that he is good.
Wow! What's this, Ray?
Let's pretend it works!
Oh boy!
Let's... let's see when Santa Claus was born!
Hooray!
Boy, is this guy talky! When are we gonna get to the Super-Secret Ice Cream Shop already?!
Oh boy! What is it what is it!
...how did you know!
Two birds with one stone!
I'm learning about gorillas, Lyle! Gorillas are nice animals that are like people!
Lyle, I am sorry! I had no idea you hated the Gorillas so bad!
...and then he said "don't tell nobody," so don't tell nobody, okay Ray?
No... but I do have a pretty neat bicycle! My mom--
W-what?
Lie Bot, what's the saddest thing?
Sure I am! I've been practicing.
Nooo!
Who's Sir Cuss-a-lot?
Chucklebot? Are you ok? Chucklebot?
Yeah, it's Chucklebot! He's funny! But he usually isn't in my room at night.
Here! I'll plug him into the wall so he can recharge!
But I thought EVERYBODY cried during Finding Nemo!
I have to get married tomorrow, Roast Beef.
Bachelor Party? What's that?
Like with Bad Morals?
But when do we act bad?
But that was just you and me! There wasn't even any music playing!
I'm almost done reading all of the Hardy Boys books! Is there a last one?
Téodor! Look what my mom sent me!
It's a Tommy the Tummy! Isn't it cool?
It's a friend for kids who are alone most of the day!
What should we do today, Tommy?
We should make natural bird feeders out of suet and pine cones, Philippe!
Okay, Tommy!
We buried french fry today, Ray.
We had to use a spatula.
Thank you for inviting me to your party.
But I thought everybody cried during Finding Nemo!
Huh?
Well, I eat at Lyle's Subway for breakfast, and Vlad's for lunch, and Todd's for dinner...
...and usually I try to pick up a six-incher at Pat's before the Late Show. Don't want to leave anyone out!
So what! I'll eat a candy bar!
Oh my gosh that's right!
It was super-expensive to make the book, and it is a huge money-loser!
But it's true, Ray! People should know!
Oh really? OH REALLY?!
I AM THE SHERIFF OF THE DUMP! TELL ME WHERE THE OLD COUCHES GO!
Nooo!
Okay Téodor
Th- This flower is going to die in the winter, Mr. Bear?
Is... is there any way to save it?
There we go 8... 7... 6... 5...
Thank you Roast Beef!
I just exercised and ate healthy!
Oh, I don't know... That's how I got so big in the first place!
Oh boy!
I learned five jokes!
Hiya Mr. Beef!
I want to go to Disneylaaand! I think I have to go to Disneylaaaaaaand!
I think I'm at that special aaaaage!
My life is special!
Children are special!
Like this?
What does this do?
What do you do with the History folder?
Oh boy!
Hello, this is Philippe! I am delighted to talk to you!
Is... is that you?
Ultra Peanut! So that was your name! You know, I felt kind of rude that I never --
Oh Boy! She's coming back!
Oh my gosh! what about Petunia and the baby?
I'll be a two-timer! I'll go to hell!
Roast Beef! Look! I'm a bumble-bee!
!
Chill Nef! I'm done.
Fuck!
Let's just go to the Circle K and grab a new one. Five finger style.
Yeah!
Shit! Run!
Run!
You killed him, Little Nephew. You killed that guy, You could go to the Electric Chair!
I- I could turn state's evidence. There's video! If I tell the cops now, I...
GASP! What are you doing with that rock? Are you going to murder me, murderer?
Two can play at that game.
Noooo!
Téodor: Little Nephew and me were bad and old and we stole and cussed and I hit him witha big rock!
A dream?
Ha ha!
Lie Bot, what is the saddest thing?
Look, this is the best that I can do. Do you like this? Does this make any sense to you?
No! Don't write anything on the paper! Just show me if you understand this hat!
Oh, boy. You're just writing more swears, aren't you?
Wow! This is amazing!
Lie Bot, I can't sleep. Will you tell me a fairy tale?
Wow! Phew.
Nooo!
Oh my gosh! Is he okay?
But...but his mom was nice to him, right?
My mother knew that I would die some day!
A snake rode a motorcycle seven miles!
