Gay black Jew mother-in-law walks into bar operated by Kramer, Jeff Foxworthy, and Tim Hardaway.
Five dollars.
Basically as I am seeink it, Ray, the problem is that you are not callink your girlfriend for five months.
You see, the hot babies like to feel wanted. If you are not callink them on the phone for a while, it is like a way of saying, "you are worst song, played on ugliest guitar."
You are comink on too strong. Does not make lady feel special.
The babies want the Make-outs to be . . . a tender secret; a soft memory to sneak away with when all alone.
Roast Beef! How are you feelink now that you are the big married guy?
What?! Already is divorce what she says?! The bitch! I KNEW it! Tonight, we drink!
Excellent! I am bringink date, is OK?
Is true what he says, actually! All our ladies have basic Ethernet. Read email during boff, surf web, whatever is needed.
Andy! Is Vlad! You are still at work?
We are agreeink to meet at Sneakers sports grill twenty minutes ago! What is deal?
There still will be barbecue sauce labels to design in the mornink! Come to Sneakers!
The dude is so self-centered! Is so shallow! Why he cannot come to simple evenink with friend?!
I... I hate Andy is so content just with his corny red Fender Stratocaster and alphabetical CD shelf! I live next door to Andy six years! We watch over two hundred DVDs at his place! But pierogi at Vlad's? Even one time? Not a chance!
Roast Beef. I am glad they call me. Am heppy to help friend in need.
Bah! I too walk down these neighborhood streets, Roast Beef.
I look in the windows, I see family's children makink imaginary airport on arm of couch.
The father smiles; he is proud of his bounty, of his beautiful achievement. He holds wife of many years.
But you, when I get to window of YOUR house!
Rye bread sandwich with Saltines as only filling.
Shower cap when usink computer, to keep hairs out of keyboard.
Always taps left hand twice before reachink for mouse.

Seriously, Chucklebot! Is goot to see you again!
You...you are well?
You are havink place to stay, Chucklebot?

Nah. But you should haf seen me in Vegas. I was in the zone, baby.
Whoo, boy. I was relivink some of my better makeouts in the shower today.
I got so horny, I ate the soap.
Hm. Where to hank Jared poster.
This not such easy nut to crack.
They are gettink rid of it!
Goes on trash heap today! Bulldozer make it into total puckey!
This couch, Philippe...is pretty raunchy. Why the tears?
Ah. I see, little guy. Vlad understand.
Cry, CRY! Let it out! To keep this pain inside, is to die!
To love, to hurt! Is life! Is way of world! Cry, Philippe! Become a man! Become ALIVE!
Now say goodbye to couch! Be stronk! Everythink must end, Philippe! YOU MUST HAF STRENGTH TO BE A MAN!
ENOUGH!
Now, we drink! We feast! We spit on the face of death for another day! BAH!

Who wants to be this dork, with his stupid face and total wiener personality?
Exactly! Now, strictly between you and me, I am writink script for Subway TV ad...

Yes, in fact it is Philippe!
Can you believe it! He is so scared of you, he hangs up!
Yes, Beef. What were you seeink?
Is SO nasty!
Is good! Is good, Téodor! I like this!
Well, obviously one idea is that he is showink off old pants of his, when wind catches them and carries him into power lines. ... Is perhaps most basic idea.
Here, why don't you just look a brainstorm sheet.
Roast Beef! Did you get video card I am sendink!
Excellent! So we are exchangink feedbacks?
Roast Beef, you are payink for all eternities!!!
So, Ray. Recently you get phone call from toughest guy in universe... who is also, surprisinkly, your father.
Are you callink back his number after? To make connect?
Hmm. Perhaps you "pocket dial" him back! Is good way for men to speak without beink all sappy with the "heys" and "yeah whats".
We go to ad. You do not leave.
Alright, so, scenario is agreed. We argue on best way of cookink steak. Dial Ramses, put phone on desk, and is off to races.
Bah! Imbecile. You want center pink as woman's rose. You want meat to give like breast.
My steak, she ravishes me. Unto me she gives the nectar of her soul.
You make love to shoe with your mouth.
I am network. You are advertiser. Six hundo and the robot with the mind in his brain is givink you back the reins to this one, baby boy.
Oh, is pleasant, but I am gettink ready to set it onto ear.
Basically idea involves Internet, and virtual feedink of sandwich to woman on web-cam.
Just standard Subway uniform until I can relocate web-cam from mop closet. Is health codes thing.
Come, see. Evaluate beta.
Sure, Roast Beef! You drive.
Haha! Chew the sandwich, you nasty dame! You are Vlad's mama-bird, tonight!
Ah yes, hello Pat. I see you are receivink my special Nat Shermans!
Ray has lunch with me before he visits you. I give him little treat to bring along.
Pat, I get what I want from you. I drive your business into the ground so that mine can prosper. I do not need you in jail.
You are aggressive businessman, Pat. I am respectink that. In fact, I have special deal for you.
A deal a fugitive like you might not want to refuse!
Full time, seven days a week. Welcome aboard.
NO photo: Absolutely there is none!
So Chris the "cartoonist" says he is takink his family to Disney the Land all week, and is no comic.
I call him wolf with clover in his teeth, and then I take over the gig. Is, "coup".
How can he be takink such time off, is makink me sick. I think this guy has a job to do, but suddenly he does not?
Instead he is makink special trip to give EXTRA money to Mickey the Mouse?
Mickey the Mouse is callink, Chris...
He is wantink to ask how was the automatic colorful machine you sit on for six seconds after one hour in the line.
Oh wait he cares not a shekel.
Anyhow.
Chris is not first man to lose his mind on diet of white wine and car payments.

So Todd, I am hearink you are back in retox! How is going?
Next guest is the broodink prince of DenMarkup Language, the SYN to my ACK, the parity bit to my party bit.. a one mister...

Question. Was ever a time there in this life, when you think to self, "I do this no more. Even happiness is torture, for pain follows like shadow. I take my own hand on quiet deer trail and let forest make use of me."
Is problem of modern age. You want lady; lady is with this dude.
You cannot kill the dude because Hammurabi, he does his thing in the day.
So, you must take the "long view," then.
I tell story.
Down the road, say, soap company of this dude is needink new conveyor belt; you haf conveyor belt, but is maybe not best price.
His pen on the dotted line, he stops. "New conveyor belt, is half of this price at Hdogreb of Smulesk."
Howaaayver-
He is rememberink good dinner party when you, clever host, get lady to do best-ever joy in the bed with him. He signs.
"Hdogreb of Smulesk has stupid ad with dancink kopeck anyway," he is thinkink.
There are two true activities. Get the lady, or get the money. Either way, is lucky I am here.
I go prepare room for the lovers. You pour them the vodka and line them inside with schmaltz and golumpki.
Gah. Is such long time since I am doink this...
On which side goes antler, on which side goes nest of dove?
AGH! I gamble, I lose.
Is Vlad, baby. We are connectink, no? You haf such sexy voice.
A woman's voice, is such rarest flower. But I pick it. Vlad picks, petal from petal, until you are nudest you are ever being.
Until you are so nude.
Is for serious? Oh, you are havink a deal, mister! Vlad born to do this job!
Dear Viewer: The chick is at the door. Is not the best chick, more of a pitesh korabka from Yugeb, if you are followink me. But the show must go on. What next.
Ahhh. Enjoyable. Findink groove.
The guy he looks at her. They are goink to do a miracle with their body parts, you bet. But first, we must ready our selfs for a good longk make out.
Wonderful.
Hold it! How quickly they are gettink to the miracle! Where are the make-outs? It does not, it CAN not work this way!
VIEWER! ATTENTION! What you are seeink is LIE! A lady is needink up to ten minutes of make-outs before the miracle! SPICE CHANNEL: I QUIT YOUR NONSENSE! -- CORNELIUS BEAR. PS: I SPIT ON YOUR MONEY.
Oh. Ray. Goot. I am just callink your cell.
We are hearink there is party?
Wienermobile is not brother. Is not like we are speakink at Christmas.
